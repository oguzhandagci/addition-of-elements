# Addition-of-Elements
In my Python for Data Science and AI course on Coursera,
I learned that, duplicate items in Sets will not be present.
For instance,
while addition of the items in “A = [1,2,2,1]” equals 6,
addition of the items in “B = set([1,2,2,1])” equals 3.
Alright, I’d understood in “Sets” duplicate items will not be present, but
I still wanted to see how this would work in code!
I needed to go several steps ahead of the curriculum
to figure out this code, but eventually, I got it!
I know it is simple blocks of code, but hey, I’m a beginner!
